            Angola, country located in southwestern Africa. A large country,
            Angola takes in a broad variety of landscapes, including the semidesert Atlantic littoral bordering Namibia’s “Skeleton Coast,”
            the sparsely populated rainforest interior, the rugged highlands of the south, the Cabinda exclave in the north, and the densely settled
            towns and cities of the northern coast and north-central river valleys. The capital and commercial centre is Luanda, a large port city on the
            northern coast that blends Portuguese-style colonial landmarks with traditional African housing styles and modern industrial complexes.

        <h2 class="about_title title">History</h2>
        <p>
          The area of current day Angola was inhabited during the paleolithic and neolithic eras,
          as attested by remains found in Luanda, Congo, and the Namibe desert. At the beginning of recorded history other
          cultures and people also arrived.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first ones to settle were the San people. This changed at the beginning of the sixth century AD, when
          the Bantu, already in possession of metal-working technology, ceramics and agriculture began migrating from the
          north. When they reached what is now Angola they encountered the San and other groups. The establishment of the
          Bantu took many centuries and gave rise to various groupings that took on different ethnic characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first large political entity in the area, known to history as the Kingdom of Kongo,
          appeared in the thirteenth century and stretched from Gabon in the north to the river Kwanza in the south,
          and from the Atlantic in the west to the river Cuango in the east.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wealth of the Kongo came mainly from agriculture. Power was in the hands of the Mani,
          aristocrats who occupied key positions in the kingdom and who answered only to the all-powerful King of the Kongo.
          Mbanza was the name given to a territorial unit administered and ruled by a Mani; Mbanza Congo, the capital, had a population
          of over fifty thousand in the sixteenth century.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Kingdom of Kongo was divided into six provinces and included some dependent kingdoms,
          such as Ndongo to the south. Trade was the main activity, based on highly productive agriculture and
          increasing exploitation of mineral wealth. In 1482, Portuguese caravels commanded by Diogo Cão arrived in the Congo[1]
          and he explored the extreme north-western coast of what today is Angola in 1484.[2] Other expeditions followed, and close
          relations were soon established between the two states. The Portuguese brought firearms and many other technological advances,
          as well as a new religion (Christianity); in return, the King of the Congo offered plenty of slaves, ivory, and minerals.

            Calandula Falls (formerly known as Duque de Bragança Falls) are waterfalls in the municipality of Calandula,
            Malanje Province, Angola. On the Lucala River, the falls are 105 meters (344 feet) high and 400 meters
            (1,300 feet) wide. They are one of the largest waterfalls by volume in Africa. The distance from Luanda is 360 km .

            The museum was established in 1938 as the Museu de Angola, and was originally housed in the Fortress of São Miguel,
            initially with departments of Ethnography, History, Zoology, Botany, Geology, Economics and Art. A library and colonial
            history archive was added. In 1956, the museum collection moved to its current 3-story building in Ingombota.
            It is located in the center of Ingombota across the street from the now demolished Kinaxixi Market.

            It was built in 1628 and is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Luanda.
            In 1716 the headquarters of the Diocese of Angola and Congo was transferred from São Salvador of Congo to Luanda,
            which eventually led the church of Dos Remedios to become cathedral. In 1877 it was in ruins, and restored between 1880 and 1900.
            At that time acquired the present appearance, as three doors and curved pediment on the façade.

            Angola is located on the South Atlantic Coast of West Africa between Namibia and the Republic of Congo.
            It also is bordered by the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia to the east. The country is divided
            into an arid coastal strip stretching from Namibia to Luanda; a wet, interior highland; a dry Savana in the interior
            south and southeast; and rain forest in the north and in Cabinda. The Zambezi River and several tributaries of the Congo
            River have their sources in Angola. The coastal strip is tempered by the cool Benguela current, resulting in a climate similar
            to coastal Peru or Baja California. There is a short rainy season lasting from February to April. Summers are hot and dry, while
            winters are mild. The interior highlands have a mild climate with a rainy season from November through April followed by a cool
            dry season from May to October. Elevations generally range from 3,000 to 6,000 feet (900 to 1,800 m).
            The far north and Cabinda enjoy rain throughout much of the year.

            Precolonial culture in Angola was broadly similar from one end of the country to another,
            albeit with local variations and some differences stemming from the many, though mostly related,
            languages spoken in the area. A common traditional culture is still noticeable in Angola.
          </p>

          <p>
            The mixture of Portuguese and African culture has made urban Angola, especially
            the Luanda region, more like a Latin American than an African country.
            Its nightclubs, restaurants, and annual Carnival might seem at home in Brazil had not
            war and security measures made this sort of social life difficult. Nevertheless, the country
            has much to celebrate in its cuisine, festivals, and artistic traditions.

            As in much of sub-Saharan Africa, palm oil is an indispensable part of many Angolan dishes, and a number of
            dishes emphasize the Angolan population’s love of seafood. The feast of Nganja, usually celebrated in April, is a harvest
            festival during which children roast corn. The Futungo market, near Luanda, provides craftsmen with a place to sell their handicrafts.

          <p>
            There are over 100 distinct ethnic groups and languages/dialects in Angola. Although Portuguese
            is the official language, for many black Angolans it is a second or even third language. The three dominant
            ethnic groups are the Ovimbundu, Mbundu (better called Ambundu, speaking Kimbundu) and the Bakongo. There are also small
            numbers of Mestiço (mixed African and European descent) and ethnic white Europeans as well.
